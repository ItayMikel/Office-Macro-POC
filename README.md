I've put all the POC files in the Releases section

A collection of files commonly used by threat actors in phishing campagins / waterhole attacks / etc...
Files that trick the user into thinking they are one thing and lunch system commands in the background.
I am using these to test and train the security systems I work with.
If you are reading this, you can use them as well if you wish  :)
